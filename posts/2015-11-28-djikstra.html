<h2 id="dijkstra-quotes">Dijkstra Quotes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not only the violin that shapes the violinist, we are all shaped by the tools we train ourselves to use, and in this respect programming languages have a devious influence: they shape our thinking habits. Comes from the passage about Java and Haskell.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved forward</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Separation of Concerns, which has become a popular concept in Computer Science, though Dijkstra used it as a means to separate different concerns in thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me try to explain to you, what to my taste is characteristic for all intelligent thinking. It is, that one is willing to study in depth an aspect of one's subject matter in isolation for the sake of its own consistency, all the time knowing that one is occupying oneself only with one of the aspects. We know that a program must be correct and we can study it from that viewpoint only; we also know that it should be efficient and we can study its efficiency on another day, so to speak. In another mood we may ask ourselves whether, and if so: why, the program is desirable. But nothing is gained -on the contrary!- by tackling these various aspects simultaneously. It is what I sometimes have called &quot;the separation of concerns&quot;, which, even if not perfectly possible, is yet the only available technique for effective ordering of one's thoughts, that I know of. This is what I mean by &quot;focusing one's attention upon some aspect&quot;: it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant. It is being one- and multiple-track minded simultaneously.</p>
