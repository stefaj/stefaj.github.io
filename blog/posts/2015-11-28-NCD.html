<h2 id="normalized-compression-distance">Normalized Compression Distance</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>The Kolmogorov complexity of a piece of text is the measure of the computable resources needed to specify the text. The complexity of a string is the length of the shortest possible description of the string in a fixed universal description language \cite{Kolmogorov1998387}.</p>
<p>The information distance between two string \(x\) and \(y\) is defined as the length of the shortest program \(p\) that can compute \(x\) from \(y\) and \(y\) from \(x\) The length of <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> can be expressed using Kolmogorov complexity \cite{681318}: \[ |p| = \max\{K(x|y), K(y|x)\} \]</p>
<p>The information distance \(p\) is a absolute measure. A more useful similarity metric is one that expresses the distance in relative terms. The NID is given by : \[ \text{NID}(x,y) = \frac{\max\{K(x|y),K(y|x)\}}{\max\{K(x),K(y)\}} \]</p>
<p>The concept of \ac{NID} is important, however it is not computable. An approximation of the normalized information distance is commonly used. \(K(x)\) is approximated by \(Z(x)\) where \(Z(x)\) is the binary length of a data \(x\) compressed by a compressor \(Z\). \[NCD(x,y) = \frac{Z(xy) - \min\{ Z(x), Z(y) \}}{\max\{ Z(x), Z(y) \}} \] where \(Z(xy)\) is the length of \(x+y\) compressed by \(Z\). Any good compressor may be used for <span class="math inline"><em>Z</em></span> such as \begin{itemize} \item Gzip \item Bzip2 \item Lempel-Ziv and its variations \end{itemize} \subsection{Literature} Normalized compression distance has been used in a variety of cases. It has been used in applications of general clustering and classification of data in arbitrary domains. This includes music classification \cite{1412045}.</p>
<p>Cilibrasi and Vitiyani used the Normalized Compression Distance to approximate the Kolmogorov Distance between different musical pieces as a method to compute clusters of music. The MIDI files were pre-processed such that when two notes occur at the same time only the note with the highest pitch is kept. The music was represented as a string and the distances between different musical pieces was computed.</p>
<p>Ctaltepe, Sonmez and Adali used the normalized compression distance and used it to classify music pieces using k-nearest neighbors \cite{Cataltepe2005}. The training data has a label associated. The closest <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> training data (by \ac{NCD}) to a song is obtained and the most frequent label in the <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> set is used to classify the musical piece. Ctaltepe Sonmez and Adali found that the distance measure works better when more training data is available and the performance is dependent on how the input data is pre processed. The best results were obtained when the midi files were sampled at <span class="math inline">1</span>ms and the <span class="math inline"><em>k</em>
