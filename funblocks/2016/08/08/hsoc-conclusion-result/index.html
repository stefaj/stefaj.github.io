  <p><em>A conclusion on the FunBlocks HSOC project</em></p>

<p>With the conclusion of <a href="https://summer.haskell.org/">Haskell Summer of Code</a> it’s time to wrap up everything
and talk about the result.</p>

<p>With this post, I’ll go through my Haskell Summer of Code 2016 project, what it
entailed and maybe a few thoughts on the subject.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-review">A quick review</h2>
<p>The project entails the creation of a <em>functional</em> block-based programming language
for CodeWorld. The aim is to create a user-friendly educational environment where
students new to the concept of programming can familiarize themselves. Once
students reach a certain maturity they graduate to the <a href="https://code.world/">text-based CodeWorld
editor</a>.</p>

<p>The project roughly comprises out of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A block based user interface in order to drag and drop blocks. (We use a
modified Blockly)</li>
  <li>Code generation in order to see the result of dragging and dropping blocks.</li>
  <li>Integration with CodeWorld in order to create CodeWorld applications and run
them.</li>
</ul>

<p>The CodeWorld language is embedded within Haskell and for this project we
generate a subset of it.</p>

<p>In order to showcase the project, I’ll go through some of the features.</p>

<h2 id="polymorphic-blocks">Polymorphic blocks</h2>

<p>Polymorphism is quite important and was required, for even a basic <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code>
statement requires it.</p>

<p>For an <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> we have the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Bool -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code>.</p>

<p>Inputs are represented on the right side (external) or otherwise within the
block (internal). The output type is given on the left side of the block.</p>

<p>Internal style block:
<img src="http://stefanj.me/funblocks/assets/internal.png" alt="Interan Block" /></p>

<p>External style block:
<img src="http://stefanj.me/funblocks/assets/external.png" alt="External Block" /></p>

<p>Taking the <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> block as an example:
<img src="http://stefanj.me/funblocks/assets/ifblock.png" alt="If Block" /></p>

<p>We have a polymorphic type indicator for the types. The color being the same
indicates all of the types are the same type variable.</p>

<p>Once a block gets get connected, the most general type might be monomorphic,
which then updates the shape of the block:</p>

<p><img src="http://stefanj.me/funblocks/assets/monomorphic_example.png" alt="If Block" /></p>

<p>We can see that this is constraining the type variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number</code></p>

<h2 id="hindley-milner-type-inference">Hindley-Milner Type Inference</h2>
<p>I think I should’ve implemented this at the start. Throughout the project,
unification was a constant problem, with some blocks not always taking on the
correct type in the given context. Much roundabout effort was spent on something
that was replaced at the end.</p>

<p>What is Hindley-Milner ?</p>

<p>It is a simple type system for lambda calculus. For this
project, <em>algorithm W</em> was implemented in order to infer the types. A simple system
of tagging was used. We tag the connection types as the algorithm goes along,
and at the end apply the required substitutions.</p>

<p>Each block is given a lambda expression. This is usually just function application to the
base CodeWorld function. For example we might have a circle block with the
radius being <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code>:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">
(circle)(3)
</code></p>

<p>with <code class="highlighter-rouge">circle</code> having the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">circle : Number -&gt; Picture</code>.
Some blocks have more advanced expressions, such as the list block:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">
a:(b:(c:[]))
</code></p>

<p>with <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code> being tagged with the correct connector block, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">[]</code>
simply being the empty list and is a placeholder.</p>

<p><img src="http://stefanj.me/funblocks/assets/listblock.png" alt="List Block" /></p>

<p>In the above list block, the polymorphic connectors in light blue would
correspond to <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code>.</p>

<p>When we have an unconnected input we fill it with a placeholder undefined, with type <code class="highlighter-rouge">forall a. a</code>. 
This forces the expression to take its type as the output.</p>

<p>With the type system in place, it is much simpler to support new blocks, as we
simply have to define its expression. The previously an ad-hoc
approach was used which was based on most general unification. This involved
specific block-logic being scattered all over the place, in order to
determine the type correctly.</p>

<h2 id="codeworld-blocks">CodeWorld Blocks</h2>

<p>Since this project is for CodeWorld we do a few things differently from Haskell:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We add syntax symbols to blocks</li>
  <li>We follow the CodeWorld convention of having types tupled, for example, a
function call would be in the following form: <code class="highlighter-rouge">f(10, 20)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>CodeWorld makes learning programming easier by making it more visual. Students
can create pictures and animations by combining various functions. We provide
the same set of functions in the Blocks UI.</p>

<p>In order to build a simple tree the user snaps together some blocks:
<img src="http://stefanj.me/funblocks/assets/treeblocks.png" alt="Tree Blocks" /></p>

<p>In order to produce:</p>

<p><img src="http://stefanj.me/funblocks/assets/treeprogram.png" alt="Tree Program" /></p>

<p>An advantage of using a block based environment to do this is that it visually
indicates the user what is valid and what the program expects. Using different
connector shapes the user can see that a picture is required for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">drawingOf</code>
block, and that the colored block takes a picture and a color and outputs a
picture. This also makes it much more difficult to build invalid programs.</p>

<p>Some more tricky blocks to implement were the function block and the list
comprehension block, as they sometimes had odd edge cases (especially in the old
type system).</p>

<h2 id="local-variables">Local Variables</h2>
<p>Another thing we do differently from Blockly is to only allow instantiation of
variables from the defining parent.</p>

<p><img src="http://stefanj.me/funblocks/assets/localvariables.png" alt="Tree Program" /></p>

<p>In order to create the <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> variable in the picture above, the user can click and
drag the white shaded <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> (next to var). These variables also can’t be connected
to somewhere, where they are outside of their defining scope.</p>

<h2 id="user-defined-data-types">User-defined data types</h2>
<p>Users are able to create their own data types. They are based on algebraic data
types (they have to be, since it’s Haskell).</p>

<p>In order to create these, the user drags a data block with which he can add sum
components. A product component can then be attached.</p>

<p>A simple example would be</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">
data Temperature = Degrees Number
                 | Fahrenheit Number
</code></p>

<p>which is given in the Blocks environment as:
<img src="http://stefanj.me/funblocks/assets/usertypes.png" alt="Temperature usertype" /></p>

<p>Ideally, a single block would have captured the idea of an algebraic data types.
More work is needed on Blockly in order to support mixing inline input styles
with external input styles.</p>

<p>Once a user data type is created, corresponding constructor blocks, and case
blocks are added dynamically to the toolbox.</p>

<p>Currently, there is no support for higher kinded types.</p>

<h2 id="code-generation">Code generation</h2>

<p>The overall flow of the program is something akin to:</p>

<p><img src="http://stefanj.me/funblocks/assets/flowprogr.png" alt="Flow diagram" /></p>

<p>These backend components are implemented in Haskell, which run in the browser
thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs">GHCJS</a>.</p>

<p>Once a change occurs on the Blockly workspace we update on the event and build a
simple AST, which is something similar to:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>data Expr = LiteralS T.Text
          | LiteralN Float
          | LocalVar T.Text
          | CallFun T.Text [Expr]
          | FuncDef T.Text [T.Text] Expr
          ...
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once we have this, the code generation is simple and is mostly a matter of
formatting.</p>

<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>Some other things that were implemented:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some support for first class functions. Functions can be used as inputs. The
most important use case here is that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">animationOf</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">interactionOf</code>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">simulationOf</code> program blocks require functions that specify the new state of
the world, event handling, drawing the world and so on.</li>
  <li>Project management - Projects can be saved and loaded. Programs can also be
shared by a URL. <a href="https://code.world/blocks#PHBEyguLbhv1ZhIpz-v6c5Q">A really simple
example</a>.</li>
  <li>Some basic help, which allows users to click on programs and load them into
the workspace.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some work also went into unseen things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improving performance</li>
  <li>Improving usability, stability, user-friendliness and error messages</li>
  <li>Ensuring that only (mostly) valid programs can be built.</li>
  <li>The gazillion bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="hsoc">HSOC</h1>

<p>This project was part of this years <a href="https://summer.haskell.org/">Haskell Summer of
Code</a> initiative, which encourages contribution to
the Haskell community.</p>

<p>A big thanks to Edward Kmett, Ryan Trinkle and others who helped organize this
year’s program.</p>

<p>Another big thanks to my mentor Chris Smith, for his thorough bug tracking,
-reporting and overall guidance.
<a href="https://github.com/google/codeworld">CodeWorld</a> is his educational environment
and I’m glad to have contributed a component to it.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Quite a lot of work went into the <a href="https://github.com/stefan-j/blockly">functional Blockly fork</a>. 
The CodeWorld functionality and -blocks are kept apart from the Blockly code, with
the Blockly fork mostly covering the functional features.</p>

<p>I’m not really sure how to measure the amount of work done. Some metrics at the time
of writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>257 commits to the <a href="https://github.com/google/codeworld">CodeWorld repository</a></li>
  <li>395 commits to the <a href="https://github.com/stefan-j/blockly">Blockly fork</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Lines of code would have been inflated for Blockly, as it would have included
the build changes. Haskell also produces fewer lines of code.</p>

<p>The project was great and I enjoyed it. It has a few issues and bugs
that still need work. Overall I think it is in a good state for future work and
can be used as a foundation.</p>

<p>Some further work might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finishing up user data types</li>
  <li>A guard block or guard functionality. Nesting <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code>s can get tedious.</li>
  <li>Mixing internal and external inputs</li>
  <li>Live previewing of values</li>
  <li>Pattern matching</li>
</ul>

<p>I suggest you check out the result for yourself at:
<a href="https://code.world/blocks">code.world/blocks</a>. If you find any bugs or missing
features, kindly help us out and <a href="https://github.com/google/codeworld/issues">file an issue on the GitHub
tracker</a>.</p>
